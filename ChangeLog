nmsg (0.11.0)

  [ Henry Stern ]
  * Add an interval randomization option that randomizes the initial offset
    within the selected time interval. This functionality is exposed via the
    libnmsg nmsg_io_set_interval_randomized() function and the nmsgtool -R /
    --randomize command-line option (#27, #33).

  * Add documention for nmsgtool -j / --readjson and -J / --write-json
    command-line options (#26, #28).

  * Add PKG_CHECK_MODULES dependency on yajl >= 2.1.0 (#29, #31).

  * Make nmsgtool -k / --kicker work when combined with -c or -t, when
    producing output in JSON format (#25, #38).

  * Fix compiler warning [-Wtautological-compare] in
    _nmsg_msgmod_json_to_payload_load() (#36, #39).

  * Add nmsg_message_get_num_field_values(),
    nmsg_message_get_num_field_values_by_idx() functions (#5, #40).

  [ Robert Edmonds ]
  * Remove the unused enum nmsg_modtype from the internal libnmsg API (#30).

  * Header file cleanups (#14, #34).

  * Rewrite nmsg_res_lookup() to use a switch, which eliminates a Clang
    warning (#14, #35).

  * Add a message filtering capability to the libnmsg I/O loop, including
    external filter module plugin and nmsgtool support (#41, #43, #44).

  [ Mike Schiffman ]
  * Add yajl/ prefix to #include's of yajl headers (#37).

nmsg (0.10.0)

  [ Henry Stern ]
  * Add JSON input and output support, including new libnmsg functions
    nmsg_input_open_json(), nmsg_output_open_json(), nmsg_message_from_json(),
    and nmsg_message_to_json(); new -j and -J command line options for
    nmsgtool; and new per-field 'format' and 'parse' methods in the msgmod
    plugin API.

  [ Chris Mikkelson ]
  * nmsg_chalias_free(): Check for null aliases list.

nmsg (0.9.1)

  * Fix a crash that was caused by incorrect initialization of
    ProtobufCBufferSimple objects.

  * Increase the required verbosity level for several noisy debugging log
    messages in the seqsrc tracking code from 5 (nmsgtool -ddddd) to 6
    (nmsgtool -dddddd).

 -- Robert Edmonds <edmonds@fsi.io>  Fri, 26 Sep 2014 15:20:49 -0400

nmsg (0.9.0)

  * nmsg now depends on protobuf-c version 1.0.1 or newer.

  * The libnmsg msgmod ABI version number has been bumped from 8 to 9. This
    requires external message modules to be recompiled and to be updated for
    the '8' -> '9' msgmod filename change. The msgmod plugin interface now
    verifies that "transparent" (protobuf-based) message modules were compiled
    against the same major version of the protobuf-c library as libnmsg.

  * Internal refactoring of memory allocation and rate limiting functions.

  * Various portability fixes for OS X.

 -- Robert Edmonds <edmonds@fsi.io>  Wed, 13 Aug 2014 13:20:52 -0400

nmsg (0.8.0)

  * Update copyright and license statements as a result of the transition from
    Internet Systems Consortium to Farsight Security.

  * The "ISC" NMSG vendor has been renamed to "base". API/ABI backwards
    compatibility with existing source code and binaries which use the old
    vendor name will be maintained. New code should begin referring to the new
    vendor name and existing code should be updated to refer to the new vendor
    name.

  * Replace the "librsf" submodule with the "libmy" subtree.

  * Fix a double free() which occurred when compression was enabled on a
    libnmsg output and an NMSG payload large enough to cause fragmentation
    before being compressed ended up being small enough to fit in an
    unfragmented NMSG container after compression.

  * The embedded copy of the protobuf-c support library has been removed.
    protobuf-c is now an unconditional build dependency.

  * The generated .pb-c.c/.pb-c.h files that the protobuf-c compiler generates
    have been removed from the nmsg release tarballs. It is now required to
    have the protobuf-c compiler installed in order to build nmsg.

  * The HTML format API documentation generated by Doxygen is no longer
    shipped in the nmsg release tarball, and is now only generated if Doxygen
    was detected during configure.

  * The DocBook manpage documentation is now generated with DocBook 5 and
    xsltproc, rather than with DocBook 4.5 and docbook2x-man.

  * The CRC32C implementation has been replaced with a new version which takes
    advantage of new instructions added to the x86-64 architecture which
    perform the CRC32C algorithm in hardware, if available. On other
    architectures and on x86-64 CPUs where these new instructions are not
    available a fallback software "slicing-by-8" implementation of the CRC32C
    algorithm will be used, which is still faster than the implementation
    shipped in previous nmsg releases. This may speed up NMSG protocol
    decoding significantly on newer CPUs where these hardware instructions are
    available.

  * If the "-T" argument is specified to nmsgtool without specifying "-V",
    nmsgtool now implicitly defaults to assuming "-V base".

  * nmsg_input_read_null(): fix inverted filter logic.
    Patch from Ray Ruvinskiy.

  * nmsg_input_read_null(): fix NULL pointer dereference.
    Patch from Ray Ruvinsky.

  * Robustness improvements in msgmodset loading.

  * The message module plugin directory is now overrideable by setting the
    NMSG_MSGMOD_DIR environment variable.

  * Convert various assertions throughout libnmsg into error returns.

  * Fix various non-portable uses where a NULL character string was passed to
    a printf() family function.

  * nmsg_res_lookup() now returns the string "(unknown libnmsg result code)"
    rather than NULL for unknown result code values.

  * nmsg_output_write() now returns a new result code nmsg_res_errno when an
    underlying call to write() fails and preserves the errno value.

  * Various debugging prints in libnmsg are now only generated when a non-zero
    debugging level is configured. Previously, libnmsg could generate
    debugging output even at the default debug level of 0.

  * nmsgtool's default debugging level is now 1.

  * New function nmsg_get_debug() to retrieve the libnmsg debugging level.

  * Ensure that the "pkt" message type cannot be used with pcap sources that
    do not use the EN10MB pcap datalink type.

  * A new "packet" message type is available which encodes IPv4 and IPv6
    network packets and can process packets from the EN10MB, RAW, LINUX_SLL,
    NULL, and LOOP pcap datalink types. An example program nmsg-packet2pcap
    demonstrates a basic "packet" reader.

  * libnmsg now exposes a new "nmsg_container" interface for marshalling one
    or more nmsg_message_t objects into a serialized NMSG container.

  * The nmsgtool "-L" and "-S" arguments are now documented in the manpage.

  * Fix the autoconf macros that detect DocBook to use the namespaced version
    of the DocBook stylesheets. (Issue #1)

  * New functions nmsg_input_get_count_container_received() and
    nmsg_input_get_count_container_dropped() which retrieve the
    received/dropped container counters for UDP NMSG input streams.
    (Issue #2)

nmsg (0.7.3)

  * The rate-limiting function nmsg_rate_sleep() has been completely
    rewritten in order to sleep much more often and with shorter timeouts.
    At low to moderate event rates, nmsg_rate_sleep() will now result in a
    system-level sleep at almost every invocation.

  * If nmsg_output_set_rate() is used to attach an nmsg_rate_t object to an
    nmsg_output_t object, nmsg_output_close() will now no longer implicitly
    call nmsg_rate_destroy() on the associated nmsg_rate_t object.
    Additionally, internal calls to nmsg_rate_sleep() will now be performed
    while holding the stream output lock. These changes allow library users
    to share an nmsg_rate_t object across more than one output.

  * Rate-limiting in nmsg_output is now performed on a per-packet rather
    than on a per-payload basis.

  * If using rate-limiting on output sockets, nmsgtool will default to a
    "freq" setting of 10 rather than the previous value of 100.

  * If using a port range to specify multiple output sockets while also
    specifying a rate-limit, nmsgtool will use a shared rate-limiter across
    each of the output sockets in the range. Due to this change and the
    switch to per-packet rather than per-payload rate-limiting, the
    semantics of the optional rate parameter to nmsgtool's --writesock
    option have changed.

  * New function nmsg_timespec_add().

nmsg (0.7.2)

  * Fix a segfault in nmsgtool when -U (--username) was specified on the
    command line without -P (--pidfile).

  * nmsg can now be built without libxs support by specifying
    "--without-libxs" to configure.

  * Build system: the directory to install the libnmsg pkg-config file to can
    now be overridden by specifying the --with-pkgconfigdir parameter to
    configure.

  * Build system: add "make check" target that runs tests.

  * Build fix: explicitly link examples/nmsg-dnsqr2pcap against libpcap.

  * Portability: use fallback htole32()/le32toh() functions on old systems.

 -- Robert Edmonds <edmonds@isc.org>  Tue, 12 Mar 2013 17:33:22 -0400

nmsg (0.7.1)

  * Fix nmsg_input_open_xs_endpoint() and nmsg_output_open_xs_endpoint() to
    be compatible with newer versions of libxs. libxs >= 1.2.0 is now
    required.

 -- Robert Edmonds <edmonds@isc.org>  Wed, 25 Jul 2012 15:24:40 -0400
