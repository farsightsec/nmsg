nmsg (0.7.3)

  * The rate-limiting function nmsg_rate_sleep() has been completely
    rewritten in order to sleep much more often and with shorter timeouts.
    At low to moderate event rates, nmsg_rate_sleep() will now result in a
    system-level sleep at almost every invocation.

  * If nmsg_output_set_rate() is used to attach an nmsg_rate_t object to an
    nmsg_output_t object, nmsg_output_close() will now no longer implicitly
    call nmsg_rate_destroy() on the associated nmsg_rate_t object.
    Additionally, internal calls to nmsg_rate_sleep() will now be performed
    while holding the stream output lock. These changes allow library users
    to share an nmsg_rate_t object across more than one output.

  * Rate-limiting in nmsg_output is now performed on a per-packet rather
    than on a per-payload basis.

  * If using rate-limiting on output sockets, nmsgtool will default to a
    "freq" setting of 10 rather than the previous value of 100.

  * If using a port range to specify multiple output sockets while also
    specifying a rate-limit, nmsgtool will use a shared rate-limiter across
    each of the output sockets in the range. Due to this change and the
    switch to per-packet rather than per-payload rate-limiting, the
    semantics of the optional rate parameter to nmsgtool's --writesock
    option have changed.

  * New function nmsg_timespec_add().

nmsg (0.7.2)

  * Fix a segfault in nmsgtool when -U (--username) was specified on the
    command line without -P (--pidfile).

  * nmsg can now be built without libxs support by specifying
    "--without-libxs" to configure.

  * Build system: the directory to install the libnmsg pkg-config file to can
    now be overridden by specifying the --with-pkgconfigdir parameter to
    configure.

  * Build system: add "make check" target that runs tests.

  * Build fix: explicitly link examples/nmsg-dnsqr2pcap against libpcap.

  * Portability: use fallback htole32()/le32toh() functions on old systems.

nmsg (0.7.1)

  * Fix nmsg_input_open_xs_endpoint() and nmsg_output_open_xs_endpoint() to
    be compatible with newer versions of libxs. libxs >= 1.2.0 is now
    required.
