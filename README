ISC nmsg
========

I. Contact information
----------------------

All questions about libnmsg, nmsgtool, pynmsg, the development of libnmsg
client programs or language bindings, or the NMSG binary protocol should be
directed to the nmsg-dev mailing list:

    https://lists.isc.org/mailman/listinfo/nmsg-dev
or
    gmane.network.nmsg.devel

II. Building and installing nmsg
--------------------------------

nmsg has external library dependencies on libpcap, libprotobuf-c, libustr,
libwdns, and zlib.

Convenience copies of libprotobuf-c, libustr, and libwdns are included in the
nmsg distribution and will be compiled and linked in if these libraries are
not found on the system.

Debian users should ensure that the libpcap0.8-dev and zlib1g-dev packages are
installed.  If available, the libprotobuf-c0-dev and libustr-dev packages
should also be installed.

After satisfying the prerequisites, "./configure && make && make install"
should compile and install libnmsg and nmsgtool to /usr/local.

To build the Python language bindings, run "cd pynmsg && make && make install".
pynmsg requires Cython >= 0.12 to be installed.

To build the Doxygen libnmsg documentation, run "cd doc/doxygen && make html".

III. Building external message modules
--------------------------------------

libnmsg can be extended at runtime with new message types by installing
message modules into the libnmsg module directory, which defaults to
$PREFIX/lib/nmsg.

External message modules may require that the libprotobuf-c headers be
available at compile time.  If the convenience copy of protobuf-c was used
when nmsg was built, you may need to add

    "-I${NMSG_BUILD_DIRECTORY}/protobuf-c"

to the CFLAGS variable when building the message module, where
${NMSG_BUILD_DIRECTORY} is the directory where nmsg was built from.

IV. Examples
------------

C language examples are in the examples/ directory.

Python language examples are in the pynmsg/examples/ directory.
