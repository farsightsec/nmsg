Contact information
-------------------

All questions about libnmsg, nmsgtool, pynmsg, the development of libnmsg
client programs or language bindings, or the NMSG binary protocol should be
directed to the nmsg-dev mailing list:

    https://lists.isc.org/mailman/listinfo/nmsg-dev
or
    gmane.network.nmsg.devel

Building and installing nmsg
----------------------------

nmsg has external library dependencies on libpcap, libprotobuf-c, libwdns,
libxs, and zlib.

nmsg will build with libpcap versions older than 1.0, but using an up-to-date
libpcap on Linux platforms is highly recommended due to support for PACKET_MMAP
capture sockets and changes in timeout handling.

A convenience copy of libprotobuf-c is included in the nmsg distribution and
will be compiled and linked in if this library is not found on the system.

Debian users should ensure that the libpcap0.8-dev and zlib1g-dev packages are
installed.  If available, the libprotobuf-c0-dev, libwdns-dev, and libxs-dev
packages should also be installed.

After satisfying the prerequisites, "./configure && make && make install"
should compile and install libnmsg and nmsgtool to /usr/local.

To build the Doxygen libnmsg documentation, run "make html".

Building external message modules
---------------------------------

libnmsg can be extended at runtime with new message types by installing
message modules into the libnmsg module directory, which defaults to
$PREFIX/lib/nmsg.

External message modules may require that the libprotobuf-c headers be
available at compile time.  If the convenience copy of protobuf-c was used
when nmsg was built, you may need to add

    "-I${NMSG_BUILD_DIRECTORY}/protobuf-c"

to the CFLAGS variable when building the message module, where
${NMSG_BUILD_DIRECTORY} is the directory where nmsg was built from.

Examples
--------

C language examples are in the examples/ directory.
